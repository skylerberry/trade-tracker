1. 12:29 PM (America/Los_Angeles)
---------------------------------
Indexes still trying to push off LOD, however, I haven't seen any 'obvious' A+ setup opportunities - QQQ: https://www.tradingview.com/x/mSWTAOzu/

Here's various stock high on my radar for tomorrow based on their constructive action today - BE, EOSE, NNE, FLNC, PL, RKLB, ASTS, LUNR, RCAT, CIFR, WULF, IREN, FIGR, INTC, AMD, MRNA: https://www.tradingview.com/x/W6Wzd840/

MRNA in particular a constructive 10d EMA currently forming: https://www.tradingview.com/x/HnbjNzz8/


2. 11:49 AM (America/Los_Angeles)
---------------------------------
Indexes showing signs of wanting to INMERELO off LOD.
QQQ: https://www.tradingview.com/x/apmctcdU/


3. 11:42 AM (America/Los_Angeles)
---------------------------------
Press conference underway, still choppy, choppy for the indexes. I haven't seen anything A+, yet.
QQQ: https://www.tradingview.com/x/PRJ6Uc2r/


4. 11:36 AM (America/Los_Angeles)
---------------------------------
Yes, on Fed Days I usually trade in the opening 90 minutes and final 90 minutes once the press conference gets underway.


5. 11:12 AM (America/Los_Angeles)
---------------------------------
No cut rate decision out, market hasn't move much, QQQ remains near LOD + yesterday's HOD. Feels like it's waiting for Powell's press conference: https://www.tradingview.com/x/I2GvqPY7/

I'm watching for A+ INMERELOs to develop. ONDS & RKLB around their 10d EMA several I'm watching.


6. 10:42 AM (America/Los_Angeles)
---------------------------------
PLTR big ol' flush to its 200d SMA. Interesting technical spot for whether it holds: https://www.tradingview.com/x/EWgerr6L/


7. 10:22 AM (America/Los_Angeles)
---------------------------------
About 40 minutes until the rate decision, and 1hr 10 minutes until the start of Powell's press conference, which is when the *real* volatility usually kicks in; especially given the market expects no cut with a 99% probability.

I like the technical location of the QQQ being around LOD and having filled the gap to yesterday's HOD. If the market likes what Powell has to say, common sense indicates a rally into the close could develop.

QQQ: https://www.tradingview.com/x/D5fDQB10/

The strongest stock today on my screens is AAOI, big move today. One I'll be watching for more opportunities around its 10d EMA: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Jhm0tbDC/


8. 8:43 AM (America/Los_Angeles)
--------------------------------
QQQ gap fill to yesterday's HOD incoming: https://www.tradingview.com/x/NwuuLuI8/

Snooze of a session so far, mostly because of the index context. Late session INMERELOs during/post Powell's speech could be where the action is.


9. 8:14 AM (America/Los_Angeles)
--------------------------------
ONDS 10d EMA


10. 8:10 AM (America/Los_Angeles)
---------------------------------
RKLB showing intraday RS vs the indexes so far. I'm liking how it's currently developing a 'Trigger Bar' on its 10d EMA: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Up0RFcO/

PL (another Space/Satellite related stock) also getting my attention with its 10d EMA TB/SDT/Inside Day: https://www.tradingview.com/x/5HE8mwYu/


11. 7:39 AM (America/Los_Angeles)
---------------------------------
IWM signs of wanting to attempt a 10d EMA INMERELO: https://www.tradingview.com/x/2IezZqbF/


12. 7:33 AM (America/Los_Angeles)
---------------------------------
Interestingly IWM (small cap ETF) at its 10d EMA and starting to show intraday RS vs indexes: https://www.tradingview.com/x/uI6nCtDn/

Might iNMERELO and thus be a constructive sign for more small/mid caps.

MDY similar behaviour: https://www.tradingview.com/x/4NmcmP2M/


13. 7:22 AM (America/Los_Angeles)
---------------------------------
QQQ choppy start going back and forth following the gap up near the ATH: https://www.tradingview.com/x/ccNwck7S/

As mentioned in recent posts, given the gap up it was always going to be a tricky open ahead of the FOMC later today. Several ORBs I took such as INTC and FLNC, so giving them a 'chance' given the current intraday RS vs the indexes. I think many INMERELOs here are 'tricky' unless there is a gap fill then U-turn (INMERELO) higher for the indexes.

On Fed days I usually only trade the opening 90 minutes or so and then wait until Powell's press conference. Why? Because my experience is often after the first 90-minutes until the press conference is chop, chop, and more chop. The big moves intraday tend to happen during or post Powell's press conference.


14. 6:47 AM (America/Los_Angeles)
---------------------------------
ASTS, RKLB, LUNR starting to show intraday RS, FIGR too.


15. 6:39 AM (America/Los_Angeles)
---------------------------------
QQQ early 'gap and fade' behaviour as it makes new session lows. If it cannot INMERELO from there, I think a good chance it flushes to yesterday's HOD for the gap fill ahead of the FOMC later today: https://www.tradingview.com/x/LyO66TFr/

Several stocks trying to show impressive intraday RS: INTC, FLNC, BE, EOSE, LITE, RCAT, IREN, MU, WDC, STX, SNDK, B, NEM, AEM,


16. 6:33 AM (America/Los_Angeles)
---------------------------------
Early intraday RS: RCAT, LPTH, FLNC, EOSE, BE, TE, HUT, IREN, AAOI, LITE, INTC, CLS, SNDK, STX,

SUMMARY
================================================

Key Themes from Jack's Comments Today (Jan 28, 2026):

1. FED DAY CONTEXT: FOMC rate decision day with Powell press conference. Market expected no cut (99% probability). Jack's strategy: trade opening 90 minutes, then wait for Powell's press conference for the real volatility.

2. INDEX ANALYSIS: QQQ choppy throughout the day, gap up near ATH at open, then "gap and fade" to session lows, filled gap to yesterday's HOD. Indexes trying to push off LOD multiple times.

3. TRADING APPROACH: On Fed days, Jack typically trades opening 90 mins and final 90 mins during/after press conference. Middle of day tends to be "chop, chop, and more chop."

4. STOCKS SHOWING STRENGTH (Intraday RS):
   - Space/Satellite: ASTS, RKLB, LUNR, PL, RCAT
   - Semiconductors: INTC, AAOI, MU, WDC, STX, SNDK
   - Energy/Clean Tech: FLNC, BE, EOSE, IREN, WULF, CIFR
   - Others: FIGR, NEM, AEM, LITE, B, HUT, NNE

5. KEY SETUPS MENTIONED:
   - 10d EMA setups: RKLB, ONDS, MRNA, AAOI
   - IWM/MDY (small/mid caps) showing RS at 10d EMA - constructive for small caps
   - PLTR flush to 200d SMA - interesting technical spot

6. WATCHLIST FOR TOMORROW:
   BE, EOSE, NNE, FLNC, PL, RKLB, ASTS, LUNR, RCAT, CIFR, WULF, IREN, FIGR, INTC, AMD, MRNA

7. STRONGEST STOCK OF THE DAY: AAOI - big move, watching for more opportunities around its 10d EMA
